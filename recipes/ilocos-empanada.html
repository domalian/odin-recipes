        <h2>What is this dish?</h2>
        <p>Another small bit from our trustworthy friend, ChatGPT: the Ilocos empanada, a popular street food from the Ilocos region in the Philippines, traces its roots to Spanish colonization when the concept of empanadas was introduced. Over time, the Ilocanos created a unique version using rice flour for the dough, giving it a distinctive orange hue from annatto seeds. The filling typically includes grated green papaya, mung beans, local longganisa (sausage), and sometimes egg. Deep-fried to achieve a crispy exterior, these empanadas are a staple of local street food, especially in Vigan and Laoag, and are celebrated in local festivals. Variations like the larger Batac empanada and the thinner-crusted Vigan empanada highlight regional preferences.</p>

            <li><em>1 cup</em> of <strong>ground pork (Filipino longganisa for authenticity)</strong></li>
            <li><em>1 cup</em> of <strong>grated green papaya</strong></li>
            <li><em>1/2 cup</em> of <strong>grated carrots</strong></li>
            <li><em>1/2 cup</em> of <strong>chopped green onions</strong></li>
            <li><em>1/4 cup</em> of <strong>minced garlic</strong></li>
            <li><em>Desired amount</em> of <strong>salt and pepper</strong></li>
            <li><em>Needed amount</em> of <strong>vegetable oil for frying</strong></li>
            <li><em>Desired amount</em>of <strong>spicy vinegar</strong></li>
            <li><em>4 pieces</em> of <strong>eggs</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps #</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong> rice flour, salt, water, and annatto oil in a mixing bowl</li>
            <li><strong>Knead</strong> the mixture until dough is smooth and pliable</li>
            <li><strong>Divide</strong> the dough into small balls, and <strong>flatten</strong> them into thin, round wrappers</li>
            <li><strong>Mix</strong> the meat, grated papaya, grated carrots, chopped green onions, minced garlic, salt and pepper into a <em>different</em> bowl to make our filling</li>
            <li><strong>Place</strong> a spoonful of the filling in the center of each rice flour wrapper</li>
            <li><strong>Crack</strong> and place an egg in the center of the filling</li>
            <li><strong>Fold</strong> the wrapper in half, sealing the edges by pressing them together. Use water to help seal the edges if needed</li>
            <li>Make sure the empanadas are tightly <strong>sealed</strong> to prevent any filling form leaking out during frying</li>
            <li><strong>Heat</strong> the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot</li>
            <li><strong>Place</strong> the empanada in the oil once it is hot</li>
            <li><strong>Fry</strong> until they turn crispy (usually around 5-7 minutes)</li>
            <li><strong>Remove</strong> the empanadas from the oil and <strong>drain</strong> on paper towels to remove excess oil. Be careful as the empanadas may stick to the paper towels as it cools off</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> hot with spicy vinegar</li>
        </ol>
